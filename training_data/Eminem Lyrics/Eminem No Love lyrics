 Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out herYeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchersI'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vowsThat's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open BiblesI think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweatAnd these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your legMoney outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenesBe good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-CartermaticYeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of daysOK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast modeI got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-codeIt's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed modeAll about my dough but I don't even check the peepholeSo you can keep knocking but won't knock me downNo love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry nowYou kicked me when I was downBut what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)You show me nothing but hateYou ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes aroundI don't need you (don't hurt me)You (don't hurt me no more)That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need youGet 'emI'm alive againMore alive than I have been in my whole entire lifeI can see these people's ears perk up as
I begin to spaz with the pen,I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick againThey say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit,now stick it in
I ain't never giving in againCaution to the wind, complete freedomLook at these rappers, how I treat them
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'emThey call me a freak cuz
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat themMan get these whack cocksuckers off stageWhere the fuck is Kanye when you need him?Snatch the mic from him,
bitch I'mma let you finish in a minuteYeah the rap is tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and umScribble out them rhymes you were going to spitAnd start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no differenceWhen I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
In the place all the way to the parking lot,
fellowSet fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metalCold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellowWhen I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellowTil I'm toppling from the top
I'm not going to stopI'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)When you so good that you can't say it
Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymorePeople just get sick cause you spitThese fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my strideYou never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blowYou'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponentIs getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentlessI smell blood, I don't give a fuck
Keep giving them hellWhere was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no loveIt's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was downBut what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see youBitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hateYou ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes aroundI don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to
see youYou get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
